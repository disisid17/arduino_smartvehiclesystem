# arduino_smartvehiclesystem
Arduino based Child safety system that uses 2 Arduino nano sense modules.
Composed of two microcontroller (Arduino Nano 33 Sense or custom PCB hardware) modules, which are pre-programed to pair with each other.
Integrated with a mobile app (alerts, system performance and diagnostic data, emergency phone calls or text messaging).
Primary module may be mounted on a vehicle or infant car seat.
When vehicle mounted, integrated into the on-board systems.
Equipped with an eSIM (for on-board cellular connection) a small camera, an Edge TPU module (for real-time person or pet detection using Machine learning).
PIR sensor (to detect motion),  3D accelerometer (detect crash impact), gyroscope (detect roll-over), a microphone (to initiate voice control if occupant is otherwise incapacitated), and temperature monitoring (how hot is the inside of the vehicle).
Secondary device is meant to be attached to a key-fob or placed on a personal item such as a purse or handbag.
Child and Pet Monitoring.
Vehicle Accident and Roll-over monitoring.
