# Arduino Smart Vehicle System

**Embedded child safety alert system**

---

## Description

This is a hardware project using Arduino Nano modules for sensing unsafe conditions (in or around vehicles) with the goal of improving child safety. It includes sensor modules, alerts, and embedded code in C/C++.

---

## Key Features

- Dual Arduino Nano sensor modules  
- Sensing of environmental or positional variables relevant to child safety  
- Potential alerts or signal outputs when unsafe conditions are detected  

---

## Getting Started

### Hardware Requirements

- 2× Arduino Nano boards  
- Relevant sensors (e.g. motion/safety sensors—specific type depends on your setup)  
- Wiring, power supply, possibly alert output (LED, buzzer, etc.)

### Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE or compatible for flashing sketches  
- C/C++ code as per the repo  

### Usage

1. Connect the sensors to the appropriate pins on the Arduino Nanos  
2. Upload the corresponding sketch(s) from the repo  
3. Test responses under simulated “unsafe” conditions (for example movement, absence, etc.)

## Possible Enhancements

- Wireless alert / remote monitoring  
- Logging of events for later analysis  
- Sophisticated sensor fusion (combine different types of sensors)  
- Power efficiency or size reduction for portability
