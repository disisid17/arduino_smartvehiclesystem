## Purpose & Motivation

Ensure safety inside a vehicle with child passengers by monitoring environmental / movement parameters using redundant sensing. Useful in scenarios like detecting risk of overheating, obstruction, or unsafe motion.

---

## Core Functionality

- Two Arduino Nano boards each with sensors (e.g. motion, temperature, proximity)  
- Real-time sensor reading & threshold detection  
- Alerting or indicator (e.g. LED, buzzer, serial output) when unsafe condition detected  

---

## Hardware Setup

- **Components needed**:  
  - 2 Ã— Arduino Nano  
  - Sensor modules (specify exact ones: temperature, ultrasonic, IR, motion, etc.)  
  - Power supply & connecting wires  
- **Connections**: How each sensor is wired to each Arduino (pin mapping)  
- Diagram (optional) showing layout  

---

## Firmware & Software

- Code written in C++ using Arduino IDE  
- Each module reads from its connected sensors, processes data, possibly sends communications or triggers local action  
- Optional: calibration (sensor thresholds), filtering  

---

## Usage Instructions

1. Assemble hardware as per wiring diagram  
2. Upload respective sketches to the two Arduino Nano boards  
3. Power on both modules  
4. Monitor outputs (LEDs / Serial monitor / buzzer)  
5. Tune thresholds or calibrate sensor responses
